## Requirements

- ruby 2.7.3
- bundler >= 2.2.19

## Compiling

- If you haven't installed bundler yet, you should install it by running `gem install bundler -v 2.2.19`.
- Clone the project.
- Go to the root project path and run `bundle install`, it will install all dependencies.

## Running

Go to the root project project path and run the script passing a file. The `/spec/fixtures` folder has some files for examples. For example, you can run `ruby bowling.rb "spec/fixtures/positive/scores.txt"` and the program will print:
